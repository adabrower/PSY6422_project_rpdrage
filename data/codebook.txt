The RPDR Age PSY 6422 project visualises data from the reality competition show Rupaul's Drag Race. It uses two datasets from the dragracer package by Steven V Miller

Steve Miller (2021). dragracer: Data Sets for RuPaul's Drag Race. R package version 0.1.6. https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dragracer

Details about the dragracer project, data acquisition, some analyses, and commentary are available on the creator's blog post "An Empirical Analysis of RuPaul's Drag Race Contestants": http://svmiller.com/blog/2019/02/dragracer-rupauls-drag-race-analysis/

The two datasets used are rpdr_contestants and rpdr_contep

rpdr_contestants has these variables:
	season: the season the contestant competed in prefixed "S"
	contestant: contestant name, note, this is the contestant's "drag name", not their given name
	age
	dob: date of birth
	hometown: given as city, state. note, two contestants are from countries outside of the US, which is included in this column, and can make for discrepancies in coding and analysing this data point

rpdr_contep has these variables:
	season: prefixed "S"
	rank: the contestant's final placing in the season
	missc: whether the contestant was awarded miss congeniality in the final episode, with 1 coding for yes and 0 coding for no
	contestant: name of contestant. note, this is the contestant's "drag name", not their given name
	episode: episode number
	outcome: where the contestant placed in the episode: win, high (top 3 other than win), low (bottom 3 other than bottom), bottom (eliminated)
	eliminated: whether the contestant was eliminated in this episode, with 1 coding for yes and 0 coding for no
	participant: whether the contestant participated in the episode, with 1 coding for yes and 0 coding for no. note: some eliminated queens have been brought back to the competition after elimination
	minichalw: some episodes contain "mini challenges", and this column indicates whether the contestant won, with 1 coding for yes and 0 coding for no
	finale: whether the episode was the finale, with 1 coding for yes and 0 coding for no
	penultimate: whether the episode was the final competition episode before the finale, with 1 coding for yes and 0 coding for no. This is significant as making it to the end of the competition, ie the top 3 or 4, is considered an accomplishment in its own right.
